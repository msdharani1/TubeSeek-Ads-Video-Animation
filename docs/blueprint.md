## Core Features:

- Day/Night Toggle: Implement a toggle to switch between day and night modes, altering the scene's lighting and color palette.
- Interactive Elements: Enable clicking on trees, bushes, and other elements to trigger short animations (e.g., leaves falling, animals scurrying) and sound effects (e.g., rustling leaves, chirping crickets).
- Parallax Scrolling: Create a sense of depth using parallax scrolling, where foreground elements move faster than background elements when the user scrolls.
- Soundscape Ambiance: Generative AI creates an ambient soundscape matching the Day/Night toggle. The sound tool creates rustling, running and flapping sounds that change and crossfade, giving a vivid sense of environmental presence. The sound tool takes the time of day into account in the volume, type, number, and frequency of changes of each sound event.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F704F) to capture the natural and serene environment of a forest.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) for the day and deep indigo (#4B0082) for the night.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#A6D1E6) for day highlights and starry purple (#9400D3) for night highlights.
- Font: 'Literata', a serif, for any displayed text. 'Literata' evokes a naturalistic style reminiscent of an illustrated book.
- Use simple, outlined icons for any UI elements like the day/night toggle.
- Design a layered 2D scene with foreground, midground, and background elements to maximize the parallax effect.
- Implement subtle animations for interactive elements and a smooth transition between day and night cycles.
